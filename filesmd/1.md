Thanks! I’ll prepare a step-by-step guide for a clean, working setup using Eternl and Lucid on the frontend, and @emurgo/cardano-serialization-lib (ASM) on the backend to verify wallet signatures. This will be a simplified flow you can directly integrate or give to Cursor for implementation. I’ll be back with everything shortly.

# Verifying Cardano Wallet Signatures with Eternl, Lucid, and CSL

In this guide, we implement a step-by-step solution for signing a message on the **frontend** (using React, Lucid, and the Eternl wallet) and verifying that signature on the **backend** (using Node.js with the Cardano Serialization Library). We will follow Cardano's CIP-30 dApp connector API for signing data and CIP-8 message format for verification ([CIP-30 | Cardano dApp-Wallet Web Bridge](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-30#:~:text=message%20to%20sign%20shown%20to,with%20the%20following%20headers%20set)) ([CIP-30 | Cardano dApp-Wallet Web Bridge](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-30#:~:text=the%20request,with%20the%20following%20headers%20set)). The process is divided into two parts:

## Frontend (React + Lucid + Eternl Wallet)

### 1. Setup Lucid and Connect to the Eternl Wallet

- **Install Dependencies:** In your React project, install Lucid (a Cardano JS library) and ensure you have access to a CIP-30 compatible wallet (Eternl in this case). Also install `buffer` (for hex encoding) if needed. For example: `npm install lucid-cardano buffer`. Optionally, use a provider like Blockfrost for Lucid (required if you need to submit transactions or query chain data).  
- **Enable the Wallet:** Prompt the user to connect their Eternl wallet. Eternl injects an API at `window.cardano.eternl`. Use Lucid to enable and select this wallet. For example: 

  ```ts
  import { Lucid, Blockfrost } from "lucid-cardano";
  import { Buffer } from "buffer";  // Node's Buffer for browser
  
  // Initialize Lucid (choose the network and provider - e.g., testnet with Blockfrost)
  const lucid = await Lucid.new({ 
    provider: new Blockfrost("https://cardano-preprod.blockfrost.io/api/v0", "<BLOCKFROST_PROJECT_ID>"),
    network: "Preprod"
  });
  
  // Request access to Eternl wallet
  const api = await window.cardano.eternl.enable();
  lucid.selectWalletFromApi(api);  // Connect Lucid to the enabled wallet API
  ```
  **Pitfall:** Always check that `window.cardano.eternl` exists before calling `enable()`. If the user doesn’t have Eternl installed, handle this gracefully (e.g., show an error or prompt to install a wallet).

### 2. Generate a Message Payload to Sign

- **Get the User’s Stake Address:** To prove ownership of the wallet, we will ask the user to sign a payload containing their stake address. Eternl's CIP-30 API provides a list of reward (stake) addresses via `api.getRewardAddresses()`. Use this to obtain the **stake address** of the connected account. For example: 

  ```ts
  const stakeAddrHex = (await api.getRewardAddresses())[0];  // hex-encoded stake address
  // Convert to bech32 for readability (Lucid or CSL can do this)
  const stakeAddrBech32 = Lucid.utils.toRewardAddress(stakeAddrHex).toAddress().toBech32();
  ```
  Here we took the first reward address (in a single-account wallet, there is typically one). We converted it to **bech32** format for use in the message. (Lucid’s `toRewardAddress` helper or CSL’s `Address.from_bytes` can convert hex to an address object and then to bech32.)

- **Prepare the Payload:** Define the data you want the user to sign. For example, a JSON object containing an action, the stake address, and a timestamp. Then convert it to a UTF-8 string. For instance: 

  ```ts
  const payload = {
    action: "login",
    stakeAddress: stakeAddrBech32,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  };
  const messageStr = JSON.stringify(payload);
  ```
  This `messageStr` might look like:  
  `{"action":"login","stakeAddress":"stake1u...","timestamp":1681234567890}`.  
  Including the stake address in the payload ensures the user is signing a message tied to their address (useful for authentication).

- **Encode the Message as Hex:** According to CIP-30, the wallet’s `signData` function expects the message as **hex-encoded bytes** ([Authenticating users with their Cardano wallet | Cardano Developer Portal](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/integrate-cardano/user-wallet-authentication#:~:text=const%20,message%29%3B)). Convert your UTF-8 message string to a hex string. For example: 

  ```ts
  const messageHex = Buffer.from(messageStr, "utf8").toString("hex");
  ```
  **Pitfall:** Make sure you encode the original message bytes to hex **once**. Do not double-encode or include any formatting not intended to be signed. For example, do **not** pass a hex string like `"48656c6c6f"` as your message expecting the wallet to convert it – you must provide actual bytes in hex form. The above ensures the message `"Hello"` becomes `"48656c6c6f"` (hex). If you pass the wrong format, the signature will be over a different data than you expect.

### 3. Sign the Message with `lucid.wallet.signData`

- **Call the signData API:** Use Lucid’s wallet instance to sign the message. Lucid internally uses the CIP-30 `api.signData(address, payload)` call. Provide the stake address in **hex** (not bech32) and the hex message. For example: 

  ```ts
  const signedData = await lucid.wallet.signData(stakeAddrHex, messageHex);
  console.log(signedData);
  /* Example output:
     {
       signature: "<long_hex_string>",
       key: "<shorter_hex_string>"
     }
  */
  ```
  This will prompt Eternl to ask the user to approve signing the message. After approval, `signedData` will contain two fields:
  - `signature`: a hex string of a CBOR-encoded **COSE_Sign1** object (this includes the signature and signing metadata).
  - `key`: a hex string of a CBOR-encoded **COSE_Key** (contains the public key and its metadata).  

  According to the CIP-30 spec, `signature` is **the full COSE_Sign1 structure** in hex, and `key` is a COSEKey with the public key bytes (`x` coordinate) ([CIP-30 | Cardano dApp-Wallet Web Bridge](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-30#:~:text=the%20request,with%20the%20following%20headers%20set)). These are not yet in a directly usable form – we’ll need to parse them to get the raw signature and key.

- **Extract the Relevant Fields:** For sending to the backend, gather all pieces of data needed to verify:
  - **Stake Address** – we already have `stakeAddrBech32`.
  - **Message** – the original message string (or you can send the hex, but the string is easier to read and compare).
  - **Public Key** – the public key that signed the message. This is inside the `signedData.key`. We can send the whole `signedData.key` for the backend to decode. (Alternatively, we could decode it on the frontend, but it’s fine to send the COSE key as hex and parse it in the backend.)
  - **Signature** – the actual signature bytes. These are inside `signedData.signature`. We will send the full `signature` hex string (the backend can either use it directly as COSE or extract the raw signature bytes from it).

  Let's prepare the data for the POST request:

  ```ts
  const { signature: coseSigHex, key: coseKeyHex } = signedData;
  const requestBody = {
    stakeAddress: stakeAddrBech32,
    message: messageStr,
    publicKey: coseKeyHex,
    signature: coseSigHex
  };
  // Send to backend (e.g., using fetch or axios)
  await fetch("/api/verify-signature", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify(requestBody)
  });
  ```
  Here we include `publicKey: coseKeyHex` (the COSE-encoded key) and `signature: coseSigHex` (the COSE-encoded signature). On the backend we will decode these. 

  **Pitfall:** Note that `coseSigHex` is much longer than a typical Ed25519 signature (which is 64 bytes = 128 hex chars). This is normal – it includes CBOR encoding overhead (protected headers, payload, etc.). For example, signing a short message might produce a `signature` hex ~150-200 characters long. **Do not truncate or alter this value**; send it as-is. Similarly, `coseKeyHex` includes more than just the key bytes (it has algorithm and key type info). If you mistakenly treat `coseKeyHex` as the raw key and use it directly, signature verification will fail (and you’ll see errors like “Invalid public key size” ([Examples of library usage · Issue #12 · Emurgo/message-signing · GitHub](https://github.com/Emurgo/message-signing/issues/12#:~:text=let%20key_bytes%20%3D%20signed_data,key_bytes))).

At this point, the frontend has sent a JSON containing the stake address, the original message, and the signature data (public key and signature in COSE format) to the backend.

## Backend (Node.js + Cardano-Serialization-Lib)

On the backend, we will verify that the signature corresponds to the message and was signed by the owner of the given stake address. We use **@emurgo/cardano-serialization-lib-asmjs** (the Cardano Serialization Library, ASM.js build) for cryptographic operations, and **@emurgo/cardano-message-signing** for decoding the COSE structures (this library implements CIP-8 message signing formats). Make sure to install these: `npm install @emurgo/cardano-serialization-lib-asmjs @emurgo/cardano-message-signing`.

### 1. Validate the Request and Parse Inputs

- **Setup Dependencies:** Import the necessary classes from the libraries. For example: 

  ```js
  const { Buffer } = require("buffer");
  const { COSESign1, COSEKey, Label, Int, BigNum } = require("@emurgo/cardano-message-signing");
  const { PublicKey, Ed25519Signature, RewardAddress, Address } = require("@emurgo/cardano-serialization-lib-asmjs");
  ```
  Ensure these imports succeed before proceeding. (Using the ASM.js version of CSL avoids needing WASM in certain Node environments like Next.js API routes.)

- **Define the verify handler:** In your Express or Next.js API route, read the JSON body. Check that all required fields (`stakeAddress`, `publicKey`, `signature`, `message`) are present. For example:

  ```js
  app.post("/api/verify-signature", async (req, res) => {
    const { stakeAddress, publicKey: coseKeyHex, signature: coseSigHex, message } = req.body;
    if (!stakeAddress || !coseKeyHex || !coseSigHex || !message) {
      return res.status(400).json({ error: "Missing fields in request" });
    }
    // (We will implement verification below)
  });
  ```

  You can also add basic format validations, e.g., check that `stakeAddress` is a valid bech32 stake address (starts with "stake") and that `coseKeyHex` and `coseSigHex` are hex strings of expected lengths. This helps catch any client-side mistakes early.

### 2. Reconstruct the Public Key and Message from Hex

- **Decode the COSE Key (Public Key):** The `publicKey` field we received is actually a COSE-encoded key. We need to extract the Ed25519 public key bytes from it. Using cardano-message-signing, we can parse it:

  ```js
  const coseKeyBytes = Buffer.from(coseKeyHex, "hex");
  let publicKey;
  try {
    const coseKey = COSEKey.from_bytes(coseKeyBytes);
    // In COSE (CIP-8), the label -2 corresponds to the public key bytes (Ed25519 `x` coordinate)
    const pubKeyBytes = coseKey.header(Label.new_int(Int.new_negative(BigNum.from_str("2")))).as_bytes();
    publicKey = PublicKey.from_bytes(pubKeyBytes);
  } catch (err) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: "Invalid public key format", details: err.message });
  }
  ```
  This code finds the key with label **-2** in the COSE key, which per CIP-8 is the raw public key bytes ([CIP-30 | Cardano dApp-Wallet Web Bridge](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-30#:~:text=%2A%20%60kty%60%20%281%29%20,Sig_structure)). We then instantiate a `PublicKey` object from those bytes. If the bytes are not 32 bytes as expected, `PublicKey.from_bytes` will throw an error (e.g., "Invalid Public Key size" if you accidentally passed the whole COSEKey) ([Examples of library usage · Issue #12 · Emurgo/message-signing · GitHub](https://github.com/Emurgo/message-signing/issues/12#:~:text=let%20key_bytes%20%3D%20signed_data,key_bytes)). By extracting using the correct label, we ensure we use the 32-byte Ed25519 key.

- **Verify Stake Address Ownership (optional):** We have a stake address (bech32) from the request. We can check that this address actually corresponds to the public key we extracted. To do this, decode the stake address and compare its key hash to the hash of our `PublicKey`:
  
  ```js
  try {
    const addr = RewardAddress.from_address(Address.from_bech32(stakeAddress));
    if (!addr) {
      throw new Error("Not a reward (stake) address");
    }
    const stakeKeyHashFromAddr = Buffer.from(addr.payment_cred().to_keyhash().to_bytes()).toString("hex");
    const stakeKeyHashFromPub = Buffer.from(publicKey.hash().to_bytes()).toString("hex");
    if (stakeKeyHashFromAddr !== stakeKeyHashFromPub) {
      return res.status(400).json({ error: "Stake address does not match public key" });
    }
  } catch (err) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: "Invalid stake address", details: err.message });
  }
  ```
  
  This step computes the hash of the public key (`publicKey.hash()`) and compares it to the stake address's hash. If they differ, the provided stake address isn’t controlled by the provided public key (potential tampering). This is a good sanity check to ensure consistency.

- **Reconstruct or Decode the Signed Message:** We need the exact bytes that were signed so we can verify the signature. The signature was produced following CIP-8, which means the wallet actually signed a **COSE Sig_structure** (including the address and payload) ([CIP-30 | Cardano dApp-Wallet Web Bridge](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-30#:~:text=message%20to%20sign%20shown%20to,with%20the%20following%20headers%20set)) ([CIP-30 | Cardano dApp-Wallet Web Bridge](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-30#:~:text=The%20payload%20is%20not%20hashed,is%20used)). We have two ways to get the signed bytes:
  1. **Decode the COSESign1:** We can parse the `coseSigHex` to get the payload and signature.  
  2. **Reconstruct the Sig_structure:** Using the known address and message, reconstruct the bytes per CIP-8 spec. (This is complex and prone to error, so we prefer parsing the COSE directly.)

  We’ll decode the COSESign1 object using cardano-message-signing:

  ```js
  let decodedCose;
  try {
    decodedCose = COSESign1.from_bytes(Buffer.from(coseSigHex, "hex"));
  } catch (err) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: "Invalid signature format", details: err.message });
  }
  // Extract the payload (the original message bytes) and the signature bytes:
  const payloadBytes = decodedCose.payload();            // Uint8Array or null
  const signatureBytes = decodedCose.signature();        // Uint8Array (64 bytes)
  const signedDataBytes = decodedCose.signed_data();     // Uint8Array of the exact data that was signed
  ```
  
  The `payload()` is the message that was signed (in bytes). The `signed_data()` gives the full bytes that were actually signed (this includes the protected headers as required by COSE). The `signature()` gives the raw Ed25519 signature bytes. If the wallet followed CIP-8 correctly, `payloadBytes` should be the UTF-8 bytes of our original message, and `signedDataBytes` is what we need to verify against the public key. 

- **Verify the Payload Matches:** We should ensure the payload inside the signature matches the `message` string we expect (to detect any encoding issues or tampering):

  ```js
  const payloadUtf8 = payloadBytes ? Buffer.from(payloadBytes).toString("utf-8") : "";
  if (payloadUtf8 !== message) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: "Message mismatch", details: "Payload in signature does not match provided message" });
  }
  ```
  
  This check confirms the text the user signed is exactly the text we intended (same JSON string). A common pitfall is a mismatch here if, for example, the front-end encoded or formatted the message differently than what the backend expects (e.g., including extra whitespace, different JSON key order, etc.). Using the same JSON string for comparison avoids that.

- **(Optional) Verify Address in COSE headers:** CIP-8 signatures include the signing address in the protected header (under the `"address"` label) ([CIP-30 | Cardano dApp-Wallet Web Bridge](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-30#:~:text=message%20to%20sign%20shown%20to,with%20the%20following%20headers%20set)). We can extract it to double-check it matches the stake address provided:

  ```js
  const headerMap = decodedCose.headers().protected().deserialized_headers();
  const addressCbor = headerMap.header(Label.new_text("address"));
  if (addressCbor) {
    // addressCbor is a CBOR Bytes representation of the address; convert to hex
    const addressHex = Buffer.from(addressCbor.to_bytes()).toString("hex");
    // The first few bytes may be a CBOR tag for bytes, strip if needed:
    const addrHexStr = addressHex.startsWith("5840") 
      ? addressHex.slice(4)  // e.g., 0x58 0x40 indicates a 64-byte bytearray in CBOR
      : addressHex;
    try {
      const addrFromSig = Address.from_bytes(Buffer.from(addrHexStr, "hex"));
      const bech32 = addrFromSig.to_bech32();
      if (bech32 !== stakeAddress) {
        return res.status(400).json({ error: "Address mismatch", details: "Signature's address does not match provided stake address" });
      }
    } catch {
      /* handle parse error if any */
    }
  }
  ```
  
  This is an additional guard: it ensures the signature was made by the same address the client claims. In our flow, since we included the stake address in the message and already compared the payload, this might be redundant. But it’s a good demonstration of how to pull the address from the COSE structure if needed (notice we had to strip a CBOR tag bytes `5840` which is a common prefix indicating a byte string in CBOR).

### 3. Verify the Signature with Cardano-Serialization-Lib

Now that we have the public key (`PublicKey`) and the raw signature bytes (`signatureBytes`), and we’ve prepared the exact signed data (`signedDataBytes`), we can perform the cryptographic verification:

  ```js
  const ed25519Sig = Ed25519Signature.from_bytes(signatureBytes);
  const isValid = publicKey.verify(signedDataBytes, ed25519Sig);
  ```
  
- **Check the Result:** The `publicKey.verify(data, signature)` method returns a boolean indicating if the signature is valid for the given data ([Authenticating users with their Cardano wallet | Cardano Developer Portal](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/integrate-cardano/user-wallet-authentication#:~:text=%2F%2F%20verify%3A%20const%20isVerified%20%3D,includes%28signerStakeAddrBech32)). We use the `signedDataBytes` (which already includes the necessary context per CIP-8) to verify against the signature. 

  ```js
  if (!isValid) {
    return res.status(401).json({ 
      success: false, 
      error: "Signature verification failed",
      message: "❌ Signature is not valid for the given message and public key."
    });
  }
  // If we reach here, the signature is valid
  res.json({ success: true, message: "✅ Signature verified. User is authenticated." });
  ```
  
  We send an appropriate response back to the client. In case of failure, including a clear error message or debug info (like which check failed) can greatly help development. For example, you might include whether it was an address mismatch, payload mismatch, or cryptographic failure.

**Pitfalls & Debug Tips:** 
- Make sure you're verifying the exact same bytes that were signed. The inclusion of the address in the signed bytes (per CIP-8) means you should not simply do `publicKey.verify(Buffer.from(message), signature)` – that will **fail** even for correct signatures. Always use the `signed_data()` from the COSE object or reconstruct according to CIP-8. In our code, `signedDataBytes` was obtained from the decoded COSE object, ensuring we use the right bytes. 
- If verification fails, log and check each step: Does the payload from the COSE match the expected message? Does the stake key hash match the address? Are the hex strings correctly formed (even length, etc.)? Logging the lengths of bytes can catch issues (e.g., a hex string of 66 bytes when 64 were expected).
- **Common issues:**
  - **Wrong encoding:** Not converting the message to hex on the frontend (the wallet might throw an error or sign something unintended). Always pass `payload` as hex string to `signData` ([Authenticating users with their Cardano wallet | Cardano Developer Portal](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/integrate-cardano/user-wallet-authentication#:~:text=const%20,message%29%3B)).
  - **Using the wrong key:** Using the COSE key hex directly in `PublicKey.from_bytes` (causing "Invalid key size" errors) ([Examples of library usage · Issue #12 · Emurgo/message-signing · GitHub](https://github.com/Emurgo/message-signing/issues/12#:~:text=let%20key_bytes%20%3D%20signed_data,key_bytes)). Always extract the `-2` field (32-byte public key).
  - **Forgetting to include the address in the signed message:** If you sign just arbitrary text without an address, you lose the ability to verify *which* address signed it. CIP-30 `signData` solves this by embedding the address. Our guide followed that, so as long as you use CIP-30 properly, the address is included in the signature’s protected metadata.
  - **Signature length confusion:** As noted, the returned `signature` is a COSE object (not just the 64-byte signature). When sending to the backend or storing, treat it as an opaque blob. Only decode it with a proper CBOR/Cose library – do not, for example, try to slice it or assume a fixed length (different payload sizes will produce different overall lengths).

By following the above steps, you set up a secure flow where the frontend signs a message containing the user's stake address with Eternl wallet (via Lucid), and the backend verifies that signature using the Cardano cryptographic libraries. This ensures the user indeed controls the given Cardano stake address. All steps are in correct order and include checks to catch common pitfalls, providing a robust implementation for Cardano wallet signature verification. 

**Sources:** The implementation aligns with Cardano Improvement Proposals CIP-30 (dApp Connector) and CIP-8 (message signing format) ([CIP-30 | Cardano dApp-Wallet Web Bridge](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-30#:~:text=message%20to%20sign%20shown%20to,with%20the%20following%20headers%20set)) ([CIP-30 | Cardano dApp-Wallet Web Bridge](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-30#:~:text=the%20request,with%20the%20following%20headers%20set)).
