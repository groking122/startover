Here is a **clear list** of all suggested improvements from the previous analysis, organized for easy tracking:

## 🔖 Improvement Summary (Complete list):

### Session & Wallet Verification Handling:
- [ ] **Avoid Aggressive Disconnect Logic** *(Step 1 – Immediate implementation)*
- [ ] Use targeted wallet reconnection via localStorage (store wallet name explicitly).
- [ ] Adjust wallet polling strategy to avoid unnecessary de-verification.
- [ ] Implement smarter UI feedback if wallet is locked rather than disconnected state.

### Security Improvements:
- [ ] Include a nonce/session token in verification message to prevent replay attacks.
- [ ] Verify Supabase security rules to avoid exposing signatures unnecessarily.
- [ ] Cross-verify stake address from message against wallet signature.

### Session Persistence & UX:
- [ ] Persist verification clearly using localStorage and React Context.
- [ ] Handle auto-verify smoothly when wallet reconnects.
- [ ] Minimize unnecessary re-verification prompts.

### Refactoring for Maintainability:
- [ ] Separate Wallet logic clearly (connection vs. verification).
- [ ] Isolate UI logic into smaller, presentational components.
- [ ] Abstract Supabase/API interactions into dedicated hooks/functions.
- [ ] Document and comment clearly after refactoring.

# 🛠 Step-by-Step Implementation (Starting with Step 1):

Let's start immediately with the most impactful issue—**Aggressive Disconnect Logic**:

---

## Step 1: **Fix Aggressive Disconnect Logic**

### ✅ Current Behavior *(Issue)*:
- Every 30 seconds, your `WalletIdentityContext` checks if the wallet is still enabled (`isWalletEnabled()`).
- If the wallet is locked or temporarily unavailable, your code instantly calls `disconnectWallet()`, resets all state, and even forces a page reload.  
- This clears verification unnecessarily.

### 🚀 Desired Behavior *(Improved)*:
- **DO NOT** disconnect instantly if the wallet becomes temporarily unavailable or locked.
- Keep the wallet session open in the UI, maintaining the cached verification.
- Only fully disconnect and reset verification if the user explicitly switches wallets or clicks "Disconnect".
- Notify the user if their wallet becomes locked, but wait for them to unlock it rather than resetting verification immediately.
- **Remove the automatic `window.location.reload()`** on wallet disconnect logic.

---

## ⚙️ How to Implement this Fix *(Detailed Steps with Code)*:

**File to Edit:** `WalletIdentityContext.tsx`

### Current problematic code example:
```typescript
// Current aggressive disconnect example
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(async () => {
    if (walletKey && !(await isWalletEnabled(walletKey))) {
      console.warn("Wallet no longer enabled, disconnecting");
      disconnectWallet();
      window.location.reload();  // 🚩 remove this
    }
  }, 30000);

  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, [walletKey]);
```

---

### ✅ **Corrected (Improved) Implementation:**

**Step 1:** Remove aggressive reload.  
**Step 2:** Introduce a gentler reconnect attempt logic.  
**Step 3:** Add a clear indication to the user when wallet is locked, rather than resetting state immediately.

**Improved Example:**

```typescript
// WalletIdentityContext.tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(async () => {
    if (!walletKey) return;

    const enabled = await isWalletEnabled(walletKey);

    if (!enabled) {
      console.warn("Wallet seems temporarily disabled or locked.");

      // Attempt gentle reconnect once
      try {
        await window.cardano[walletKey].enable();
        console.info("Wallet was temporarily locked, now re-enabled.");
        // Re-fetch stake address or refresh state here, if needed
        await fetchStakeAddress(walletKey);
      } catch (err) {
        // If reconnecting fails, don't reset state immediately.
        console.warn("Wallet reconnect failed, wallet might be locked. Awaiting user action.");
        // Notify user wallet is locked (optional improvement)
      }
    }
  }, 30000);

  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, [walletKey]);
```

---

### 🎨 **Optional UX Enhancement (User Notification):**

You can further enhance user experience by clearly indicating the wallet state:

```typescript
const [walletLocked, setWalletLocked] = useState(false);

useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(async () => {
    if (!walletKey) return;

    const enabled = await isWalletEnabled(walletKey);

    if (!enabled) {
      setWalletLocked(true);
      try {
        await window.cardano[walletKey].enable();
        console.info("Wallet re-enabled successfully.");
        await fetchStakeAddress(walletKey);
        setWalletLocked(false);
      } catch {
        console.warn("Wallet still locked or unavailable.");
      }
    } else {
      if(walletLocked) setWalletLocked(false);
    }
  }, 30000);

  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, [walletKey, walletLocked]);
```

Then, in your UI component (e.g., TopBar), show an indicator:

```jsx
// TopBar.tsx
{walletLocked && (
  <div className="notification">
    🔒 Wallet is locked. Please unlock your wallet to continue.
  </div>
)}
```

---

## 🧪 **Testing the Changes**:
- Connect your wallet (Eternl).
- Wait for Eternl to auto-lock after inactivity.
- Observe that your app no longer auto-disconnects or reloads the page.
- Verify that your UI displays the "wallet locked" notification.
- Unlock the wallet in Eternl—ensure the app reconnects gracefully without losing verification.

---

## 🚩 **Next Steps After Successful Implementation**:
After you've successfully implemented and tested this change, we'll proceed with:

- **Step 2**: Use localStorage to explicitly store the wallet name and reconnect more robustly.
- **Step 3**: Improve security by adding nonce/session tokens to verification messages.
- Continue progressively improving your app based on the above list.
