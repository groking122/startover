# Plan for Identifying Unnecessary Files

## Analysis Approach

I'll analyze the codebase using the following methods:
- Examine file naming patterns to identify duplicates, backups, and temporary files
- Review file content and purpose to identify deprecated or unused code
- Check for redundant files across different directories
- Identify test files that aren't needed in production
- Look for unused dependencies in package.json

## File Categories to Analyze

### A. Configuration Files
- Look for duplicate or outdated configuration files
- Identify configuration files for development environments only

### B. Documentation Files
- Identify outdated or redundant documentation
- Look for draft documents and notes that are no longer relevant

### C. Test Files
- Identify test files that aren't needed in production
- Look for outdated test files that don't match current implementation

### D. Migration Files
- Identify completed migration scripts that are no longer needed
- Look for backup files created during migrations

### E. Development Scripts
- Identify scripts used only during development
- Look for utility scripts that are no longer used

### F. Asset Files
- Identify unused images, icons, or other assets
- Look for duplicate or outdated assets

## Implementation Plan

1. **Initial Scan**: Perform an initial scan of the codebase to identify potential candidates for removal
2. **Detailed Analysis**: Analyze each candidate file to determine if it's truly unnecessary
3. **Categorization**: Categorize files based on removal criteria
4. **Documentation**: Document each file with a brief explanation of why it can be safely removed
5. **Folder Structure**: Design a folder structure for organizing files for later manual removal
