      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Setup Project Structure and Wallet Connection",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Next.js project setup and Cardano wallet connection implementation into detailed technical subtasks, focusing on separation of concerns between project configuration, component architecture, wallet API integration, and state management.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves both project setup and wallet integration which requires specialized knowledge of Cardano's CIP-30 standard. The wallet connection involves multiple wallet providers and state management, increasing complexity."

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Dual-Address Verification System",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the implementation steps for a secure dual-address verification system in Cardano, including cryptographic signature handling, API endpoint creation, and database integration, with clear separation between frontend and backend components.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves cryptographic operations (Ed25519 verification) and security-critical authentication flows. Handling both stake and payment addresses adds complexity, and the implementation spans both client and server sides."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Set Up Database Schema and Row-Level Security",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Create detailed subtasks for implementing a secure Supabase database structure with proper relations between Users and Messages tables, including specific RLS policies, indexes, and connection configuration.",
      "reasoning": "Database schema design with security policies requires careful planning. The Row-Level Security implementation adds complexity as it must correctly restrict access while allowing legitimate operations."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Session Management System",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the session management system implementation into specific technical subtasks covering secure storage mechanisms, encryption approaches, server validation, and the user re-authentication flow.",
      "reasoning": "Session management involves security considerations for storing sensitive data and managing state across the application. The time-based expiration and refresh functionality add complexity to ensure a seamless user experience."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Basic Messaging Functionality",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the implementation steps for a secure messaging system between Cardano addresses, including UI components, database operations, and API endpoint design with proper validation and error handling.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires both frontend and backend work to create a functional messaging system. It involves stake address validation, database operations, and creating a usable interface for message history."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Rate Limiting Protection",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Specify the technical implementation details for a database-backed rate limiting system, including middleware design, different rate limit rules for various actions, and user feedback mechanisms.",
      "reasoning": "Rate limiting requires tracking request frequency and implementing appropriate middleware. The complexity is moderate as it involves database operations and middleware integration, but follows established patterns."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Enhanced Chat User Interface",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the chat UI implementation into specific component-level tasks, detailing the styling requirements, state management for different message states, and responsive design considerations.",
      "reasoning": "This is primarily a frontend task focused on UI components and user experience. The complexity comes from handling different states (loading, error) and ensuring responsive design across devices."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Recent Conversations View",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the specific implementation steps for creating a conversations list feature, including database query optimization, UI component design, and state management between conversation selection and message display.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires efficient database queries to aggregate conversation data and UI components that interact with the message history view. The complexity involves data aggregation and component interaction."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Error Handling and User Feedback",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Specify the implementation details for a comprehensive error handling system, including global error boundaries, toast notification integration, and specific error handling for different application features.",
      "reasoning": "This task spans the entire application but follows established patterns for error handling. It's important for user experience but technically straightforward to implement with modern React error handling approaches."
    },
